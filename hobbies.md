# Hobbies

## Singing

<br>Music gives me power. Every song feels like a new journey to me. I love many types of music, such as jazz, soul, R&B, and fusion. My favorite musician is **Frank Ocean**, and my favorite album is *Blond*. In China, my favorite singer is Tia Rayâ€”she is incredibly talented.

I've participated in several singing competitions at my school and won a few prizes. But what really excites me is meeting friends who share the same interests. Friendship is the real magic!

## Personality Psychology

<br>Aside from behavioristic psychology theory, I am also fascinated by theories based on archetypes and the unconscious. I don't think these interests are contradictory or irreconcilable. Ever since Freud introduced the concept of the unconscious, we have acknowledged its existence. I have read quite a lot books in this field, such as Jacobi's *Jungian Psychology*, Jung's *Psychological Types*, Briggs Myers' *Gifts Differing*, Beebe's *Energies and Patterns in Psychological Type* and several works by Adler, Freud and Horney. Since I have not studied it systematically and have only focused on the Psychoanalytic school of thought, I prefer to describe it as a hobby rather than a research orientation.

Take myself as a instance, my MBTI is **INTJ** and my Enneagram type is **5w4 sx/sp**. Now, congratulations on getting to know me better! 




## Fitness

Going to the gym regularly keeps me refreshed and recharged, which enhances my focus on scientific research.
