In the past three years, I've attempted several research topics such as people's attitudes towards health issues, the role of social media in disaster, and online presentation of LGBTQ groups, etc. Thanks to these diverse research experiences, I've gained a deeper understanding of both scientific research and myself. I've also developed a range of research skills and decided to pursue an empirical approach in the future.

Now, my research interests focus on two main areas. Now, my research interests focus on two main areas. First, I'm fascinated by the factors that influence how people approach, understand, and engage with **SHER**-related messages, especially at the psychological level. This could help us enhance the persuasive impact of these messages. Second, I'm intrigued by the intersection of **health** and **LGBTQ** issues. I'm particularly interested in how social and cultural factors shape the health perspectives, behaviors, and outcomes of LGBTQ groups, and how these contribute to health inequalities. I'm excited to dedicate my efforts to these two fields in the future.
