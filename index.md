## My Story

As a first-generation college student and LGBTQ individual in China, I describe my career as a personal yet never lonely exploration.

Like Alex in *Modern Family*, I grew up in a warm but non-career-supporting family during my first 15 years. While my family couldn't afford after-school tutor fees like others, I still made it into Yali, the best high school in Hunan Province. However, in the year of my college entrance examination, I faced some of the toughest challenges in my life. First, I struggled with my self-identity as a homosexual, grappling with the conservative attitudes towards gay people in China. Second, my parents divorced, and my father lost his job due to Covid-19 after I was assigned to live with him. He is still unemployed today. Lastly, I scored the lowest grade in history on the college entrance examination due to a psychological breakdown. Additionally, due to policy reforms, I was unable to pursue the psychology or any quantitative field I had always wanted to study.

Fortunately, I was still accepted into Nanjing Normal University, majoring in Network and New Media, a field I am also passionate about. During my undergraduate years, I had to work as a private tutor to support my studies because of my fatherâ€™s unemployment. But these obstacles never dampened my love for knowledge. They became my sanctuary, giving me energy whenever I felt down. I became obsessed with social science theories and I have read nearly 70 books during my undergraduate years. Over time, I managed to overcome my psychological issues and maintain a high GPA, which gave me a sense of satisfaction in my life.

Things took a turn for the better when I met my current mentor, Prof. Hao Gao, who ignited my passion for academic research. He recognized my potential through my final exam and coursework and encouraged me to engage in academic research. He offered to advise me whenever I needed. After much consideration, I devoted myself to challenging but fulfilling academic research under his guidance. I worked with his graduate students, which required me to learn nearly double the amount of content and knowledge while balancing my undergraduate coursework. However, my passion for research and resilience kept me going. I have published one SCI article, three SSCI articles, and presented at four conferences.

Thanks to Prof. Haoâ€™s mentorship, I discovered my genuine love for research and my future career as a social scientist. I am now determined to pursue a PhD in the U.S., which is unprecedented in our department. My personal exploration is still ongoing. If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat.

## Research Interests

- Science, Health, Environmental, and Risk Communication (ComSHER)
- Cognition
- Interpersonal Communication
- LGBTQ+ studies
- Social Networks
- Quantitative methods

In the past three years, I've attempted several research topics such as people's attitudes towards health issues, the role of social media in disaster, online presentation of LGBTQ groups, and etc. Thanks to these diverse research experiences, I've gained a deeper understanding of both scientific research and myself. I've also developed a range of research skills and decided to pursue an empirical approach in the future.

Now, my research interests focus on two main areas. First, I'm fascinated by the factors that influence how people approach, understand, and engage with **SHER**-related messages, especially at the psychological and cognitive level. Second, I am particularly interested in the **adolescents** and **LGBTQ issues**. For example, I'm particularly interested in how social and cultural factors shape the health perspectives, behaviors, and outcomes of LGBTQ groups, and how these contribute to health inequalities. Last, I'm intrigued by the **quantitative methods** (e.g. social networks, computational methods). I seek to advance these skills in my graduate studies. I'm excited to dedicate my efforts to these fields in the future.
